Moved to [settings](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      $ docker compose run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    $ docker compose run --rm django mypy api

#### Running tests

    $ docker compose run --rm django ./manage.py test apps

The following details how to deploy this application.
